### Project description

**Cute Animals** is a dark fantasy single-user dungeon RPG made as a semester project for the Software Engineering course at Jagiellonian University  
The game is available at https://io-rpg.herokuapp.com/.

#### Gameplay

The game is using a text-user-interface inspired by the Single-User Dungeon genre *(ex. Otchłań (pol))*.
The player interacts with the world by typing in proper commands such as `go`, `investigate` or `pick`.
Full list of available commands is in the *Documentation* section.

The game flow is as follows:
1. First, the player picks his character's class.
1. Every class offers unique abilities.
1. The player goes through successive locations, where he has the opportunity to explore, interact with other characters (e.g. conversation, fight), and collect items.
1. At each stage of the game, there are different possible courses of the game.
1. The collected items can be used in the further course of the game (depending on the item: for combat, defense, or to increase a given attribute)
1. As the player overcomes successive obstacles, the player will gain experience and develop individual attributes.
